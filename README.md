This is a 3D first person shooter game. The game takes place in an area called Goblens Heaven,
where goblens make a nice welcome to everyone who visits them.
The place is inspired by a poet and philosopher from the 10th century called Abulola Moarrensis,
in which he described a heaven for the goblens in his book "The Epistle of Forgiveness" - imaginary book for hell and heaven in the afterlife.
